     Comment:
     A: Sections shows the presence of a fibroepithelial lesion showing the
     presence of benign breast ducts within fibrous stroma showing focal
     mild increase in cellularity.  The overall features are consistent
     with the diagnosis of a fibroadenoma.
     
     B: Sections show the presence of one duct showing ductal proliferation
     with atypia. This duct disappears on deeper levels. This duct is
     suspicious for atypical ductal hyperplasia. Some ectatic ducts
     surrounded by chronic inflammatory cells are present. Calcification is
     noted within the breast tissue.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION
 ? Carcinoma. Suspicious non-mass enhancement 2 site. A) 9g 13 cores

 DIAGNOSIS
 A. Breast (left lateral), core biopsy:

 papilloma showing apocrine metaplasia and epithelial as well as
 myoepithelial proliferation. The papilloma shows sclerosis. The
 breast tissue also shows duct ectasia and columnar cell changes.
 Complete excision of the papilloma should be considered.

     cluster of atypical cells that lies detached from the surrounding
     stroma.  This fragment of tissue disappears on serial sections and
     thus its significance is unclear.  Rebiopsy of this lesion is
     suggested.
     
     B.  Sections of the breast tissue show poorly differentiated invasive
     ductal carcinoma, NOS with cancerization of lobules.  Invasive tumour
     necrosis and lymphovascular invasion are not seen.

 Specimen #: S08-32591
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION
 A) 9 G 6 cores MRI VAC. In the upper inner quadrant. B) 9 G 10 cores
 MRI Vac. At 12 o'clock.
 
 SPECIMENS SUBMITTED
 A: Right breast, medial core biopsy

 DIAGNOSIS
 A. Right breast medial core biopsy:
 CONSISTENT WITH FIBROADENOMA.
 
 B. Right breast lateral core biopsy:

 COMMENT:
 A. The core biopsy shows the presence of fragments of fibroepithelial
 lesion with focal ductal hyperplasia. The ducts are surrounded by a
 mildly cellular stroma. No atypia or evidence of malignancy is
 present. The overall features are those of a complex fibroadenoma.
 
 B. The core biopsy shows the presence of dense stromal fibrosis in
 which occasional benign breast ducts are present. Calcification is
 noted within the breast tissue.

     DIAGNOSIS
     Left breast core biopsy:
     AT LEAST ATYPICAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA.
     
     COMMENT:  The core biopsy shows the presence of one duct with a
     cribriform morphology. The features in this duct are those of low
     grade in situ ductal carcinoma, cribriform type.  Adjacent ducts show
     focal atypical ductal hyperplasia. Since only one duct shows features
     of low grade in situ ductal carcinoma, the diagnosis is consistent
     with atypical ductal hyperplasia. Dystrophic calcification is noted
     within the breast ducts.

AND CORE BIOPSY

HISTORY: Left mammographic and sonographic mass and
calcifications, outside FNA positive but core biopsy negative for
malignancy. Right sonographic mass.

Films were compared with previous outside imaging.

FINDINGS:

MAMMOGRAM/MAGNIFICATION VIEWS:

The breast tissue is dense.

There is an obscured mass in the left lower outer anterior breast
with overlying calcifications; the calcifications that directly
overlie the mass are fine and irregular. Some additional
calcifications extend roughly 4 cm posterior and 5 cm superior to
the mass are punctate and loosely scattered, with a benign
appearance.

There are right central calcifications; magnification views show
these to be in a loose cluster with some punctate calcifications
and many of the calcifications showing layering on the straight
lateral view, with a benign appearance

There is no architectural distortion.

ULTRASOUND:

Targeted right breast ultrasound to the upper outer quadrant shows
shadowing tissue and scattered cysts. In the 11 o'clock position
5 cm from the nipple there is a vague avascular hypoechoic lesion
measuring 1.2 x 0.5 x 1.0 cm. This corresponds to the lesion
imaged on the outside ultrasound. The appearance today is more in
keeping with a fat lobule rather than a solid mass like a
fibroadenoma.

Left axillary ultrasound shows a couple of lymph nodes with
slightly prominent cortex, marker measures 1.1 x 0.6 x 2.3 cm,
with the cortex measuring 0.4 cm. The fatty hilum is preserved.

Whole left breast ultrasound shows shadowing tissue and scattered
cysts. In the 5 o'clock position 2 cm from the nipple,
corresponding to the mammographic mass and calcifications, there
is an avascular hypoechoic irregular mass with posterior shadowing
measuring 1.9 x 1.1 x 1.9 cm. There are prominent arteries on
either side of the mass.

BIOPSY:

Informed consent. Sterile technique and ultrasound guidance used.
The skin/subcutaneous tissues over the axillary lymph node and
breast mass were infiltrated with 5 cc of 2% lidocaine. An 18G
needle was inserted into the axillary lymph node cortex and
aspiration was performed. Sample sent in a container to cytology.
No immediate complications. A skin nick was made over the breast
mass. A 14G core biopsy needle was used to obtain 4 samples
however the samples were small and fragmented, thus a 16G core
biopsy needle was used to obtain 5 samples. Samples sent in
container to pathology. No immediate complications.
IMPRESSION:

1. Right and left mammographic calcifications are likely benign,
recommend 6 month follow up magnification views.

2. Right sonographic mass is likely benign, recommend 6 month
targeted ultrasound.

3. Left mammographic and sonographic mass and overlying
calcifications are suspicious - core biopsy was performed and an
addendum will be dictated when pathology results are available.

4. Left axillary lymph node is indeterminate - fine needle
aspiration was performed and an addendum will be dictated when
cytology results are available.

5. Dense breasts. Due to the suspicious mass, recommend breast
MRI. Please submit a requisition for this.

Addendum # 1 by Carrie Betel on 2009-Oct-14 0937

ADDENDUM:

Cytology of the axillary lymph node is benign. This is concordant
with imaging. Recommend 6 month ultrasound follow up.

Pathology shows ALH/LCIS. Please refer to the full pathology
report. This could be concordant with imaging however surgical
excision is recommended to exclude underlying invasive malignancy.

Note that breast MRI has been performed, please refer to that
report for MRI findings and recommendations.

Also note that bilateral magnification views and right targeted
ultrasound in 6 months are also recommended.

     COMMENT:
     The first biopsy shows predominantly in-situ carcinoma, solid and
     cribriform type with intermediate nuclear grade and comedo necrosis.
     There is a small component of invasive carcinoma, intermediate grade.
     The second biopsy shows predominantly invasive carcinoma, intermediate
     grade, with a small component of in-situ carcinoma.
     Invasive tumour necrosis and lymphovascular invasion are not seen in

     carcinoma of the solid subtype. The nuclear grade is 3/3. Comedo
     necrosis and calcification are noted in the DCIS. Some dissociated
     tumor cells are present. They are likely derived from the DCIS.
