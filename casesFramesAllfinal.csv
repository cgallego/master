 Specimen #:S01-13829

 Final Diagnosis
 
 Right breast tissue: FATTY TISSUE AND FOCAL DUCT PAPILLOMATOSIS
 WITHOUT ATYPIA, please see comment
 
 COMMENT: This lumpectomy has been completely examined in 52 blocks.
 Ninety percent of the lump is formed by mature adipose tissue with
 delicate vascular fibrous septae. Scattered throughout the lump are
 dense fibrous septae of 1-2 mm thickness surrounding dermal ducts or
 small atrophic breast lobules. In the middle part of this specimen in
 block 20 there is a small duct papilloma and another focus of mild
 ductal hyperplasia without atypia in the lateral end of the lump
 (block 44). Vessels of variable size are scattered throughout the
 lesion as one would expect to see in normal breast. Some are present
 around the terminal ducts or small ascinar lobules present as part of
 the neurovascular bundles. Occasionally small clusters of blood
 vessels are present within the fat but these are not associated with
 any breast parenchyma. The enhanced nodule seen on the mammographic
 examination of this specimen is a lobule of adipose tissue surrounded
 by thin fibrous septae.
 
 In summary, complete examination of this specimen in 52 blocks reveals
 mostly adipose tissue with its fibrovascular components and a very
 small duct papilloma as a focus of mild ductal hyperplasia without
 atypia.

 Addendum Diagnosis
 In the area of radial scar, angulated tubular structures were seen.
 Myosin SM and p63 were performed to exclude tubular carcinoma arising
 in radial scar. Both immunohistochemical stains were positive for
 myoepithelial cells, supporting the interpretation of radial scar. No
 carcinoma identified in the specimen. The diagnosis is finalized.

     CLINICAL INFORMATION
     Both sites irregular suspicious areas. Previous ADH. A) 14 G  4 cores.

     A.  Right breast (site A), core biopsy:
     INVASIVE DUCT CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST
     
     B.  Right breast (site B), core biopsy:
     IN-SITU DUCT CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST WITH AT LEAST MICROINVASION
     
     COMMENT:
     The first biopsy (site A) shows invasive duct carcinoma of no special
     type with intermediate to high nuclear grade.  The tumour shows no
     tubule formation.  There is no invasive tumour necrosis.  There is a
     very small component of in-situ carcinoma, cribriform type with
     intermediate nuclear grade and no comedo necrosis.  Calcifications are
     seen associated with the invasive component.
     The second biopsy (site B) shows predominantly in-situ carcinoma with
     solid and cribriform patterns, intermediate nuclear grade and comedo
     necrosis.  There is sclerosing adenosis and this shows cancerization
     of lobules.  There is also a focus of microinvasion.  Given that this
     is only a small biopsy of a larger lesion, a larger focus of invasion
     elsewhere cannot be ruled out.

     SURGICAL  PATHOLOGY  REPORT

     Encounter #: 5609093R
     Specimen #: S08-18693
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION
     Both sites irregular suspicious areas. Previous ADH. A) 14 G  4 cores.
     1-2H 5N. B) 14 G  6 cores. 7H 2N.
     
     SPECIMENS SUBMITTED
     A: Right Breast, core biopsy
     B: Right Breast, core biopsy
     
     
     
     DIAGNOSIS
     A.  Right breast (site A), core biopsy:
     INVASIVE DUCT CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST
     
     B.  Right breast (site B), core biopsy:
     IN-SITU DUCT CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST WITH AT LEAST MICROINVASION
     
     COMMENT:
     The first biopsy (site A) shows invasive duct carcinoma of no special
     type with intermediate to high nuclear grade.  The tumour shows no
     tubule formation.  There is no invasive tumour necrosis.  There is a
     very small component of in-situ carcinoma, cribriform type with
     intermediate nuclear grade and no comedo necrosis.  Calcifications are
     seen associated with the invasive component.
     The second biopsy (site B) shows predominantly in-situ carcinoma with
     solid and cribriform patterns, intermediate nuclear grade and comedo
     necrosis.  There is sclerosing adenosis and this shows cancerization
     of lobules.  There is also a focus of microinvasion.  Given that this
     is only a small biopsy of a larger lesion, a larger focus of invasion
     elsewhere cannot be ruled out.
     
     
     
     
     MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
     A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'right
     breast core biopsy site A'. The accompanying requisition matches the
     container' s label.The specimen consists of 4 cores of tan and fatty
     tissue, each with a diameter of 0.1 cm, ranging from 0.5 to 1.2 cm in
     length. Submitted in toto in one block.
     
     B. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'right
     breast core biopsy site B'. The accompanying requisition matches the
     container' s label. The specimen consists of 6 cores of tan and fatty
     tissue, each with a diameter of 0.1 cm, ranging from 0.4 to 1.6 cm in

     Comment:  Sections show four tissue cores, all extensively involved by
     invasive ductal carcinoma, that shows lobular features with a
     discohesive pattern of invasion.  Some areas show a marked lymphocytic
     reaction.  Nuclear grade is low to intermediate.  There is no evidence
     of lymphovascular invasion.  Invasive tumour necrosis is not seen.
     Focal areas of ductal carcinoma in situ are seen.  Positive E-cadherin
     immunostaining of neoplastic cells supports the diagnosis of a duct
     carcinoma.

     Encounter #: 16527808R
     Specimen #: S10-16269
     
     CLINICAL INFORMATION
     A) 14 G  7 cores. Collection of hypoechoic areas (MR finding). B) 14 G
     6 cores. Complex cystic mass  (MR finding)
     
     SPECIMENS SUBMITTED
     A: Right breast, core biopsy
     B: Left breast, core biopsy
     
     
     
     DIAGNOSIS
     A.  Right breast, core biopsy:
     PAPILLARY LESION CONSISTENT WITH LARGE DUCT PAPILLOMA  SEE COMMENT
     
     B.  Left breast, core biopsy:
     SUGGESTIVE OF A FIBROADENOMA
     
     COMMENT:
     The first biopsy shows portion of papillary lesion that is present in
     several sections and ducts.  The appearance is consistent with a large
     duct papilloma.  There is no evidence of atypia or malignancy in the
     portion of the lesion sampled.
     The second biopsy shows a few areas with a fibroadenomatoid
     architecture and myxoid stroma.  Although only a small portion of the
     lesion is sampled, the appearance is suggestive of a fibroadenoma.
     Although cystic areas are not seen, some proteinaceous debris that may
     have originated in a cyst is present.
     
     
     
     
     MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
     A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'right
     breast core biopsy'. The accompanying requisition matches the
     container's label.The specimen consists of 7 cores of tan and fatty
     tissue, each with a diameter of 0.1 cm, ranging from 0.3 to 1.3 cm in
     length. Submitted in toto in two blocks.
     
     B. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     breast core biopsy'. The accompanying requisition matches the

     Comment:
     Sections show a very similar appearing tumour in specimen A and B.
     This is an intermediate to high grade invasive ductal carcinoma. One
     focus is suspicious for lymphovascular invasion. Both specimens have
     high grade in-situ component; in specimen B this shows comedo
     necrosis. Calcifications are associated with the lesion.
     
     
     
     
     MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
     A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     breast core biopsy, site 8, 2 o'clock'. The accompanying requisition
     matches the container' s label.  Specimen consists of 4 cores of
     fibrofatty tissue.  Each core has a diameter of 0.2-cm.  The cores
     range in length from 0.5 to 1.3 cm, submitted in total in one block.
     
     B. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     breast core biopsy, site B, 4 o'clock'. The accompanying requisition
     matches the container' s label.  The specimen consists of 4 cores of
     fibrofatty tissue.  Each core has a diameter of 0.2-cm.  The cores
     range in length from 0.6 to 1.4-cm.  The specimen is submitted in
     total in one block.

     HER2/neu Oncoprotein Overexpression Immunohistochemistry:
     
     The tumor cells show strong complete membranous staining for the
     HER2/neu oncoprotein in 100% of the tumor cells.  This indicates that
     there is over-expression of the Her2/neu oncoprotein.  This
     corresponds to 3+ positivity. Parallel positive controls were run with
     the test and were adequate.

     COMMENT:
     Sections from site A shows an intermediate grade invasive duct
     carcinoma NOS with focal fibrosis and microcalcifications.  There is
     no evidence of lymphovascular invasion.  Also present is part of a
     lymph node which shows reactive changes, mainly in the form of
     dermatopathic lymphadenitis.
     
     The biopsy from the left breast site B shows mainly duct carcinoma in
     situ, grade 2, cribriform with no comedo necrosis but there are also
     focal areas of invasion.  There are no lymphovascular emboli noted in
     the sections examined.

     MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
     A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and
     'sentinel lymph node #1, count 606,blue. The accompanying requisition
     matches the container' s label.  The specimen consists of one possible
     lymph node measuring 1.8 cm in greatest dimension and yellow
     fibroadipose tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm in aggregate.  The
     lymph node is serially sectioned and submitted in toto in 3 blocks
     (FS).
     
     B. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and
     'sentinel lymph node #2'. The accompanying requisition matches the
     container' s label.  The specimen consists of one possible lymph node
     measuring 0.6 cm in greatest dimension and yellow fibroadipose tissue
     aggregating to 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm.  The lymph node is bisected and
     submitted in toto in one block.
     
     C. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and' right
     breast tissue'. The accompanying requisition matches the container' s
     label.  The specimen consists of oriented breast lump (long
     suture-lateral, short suture-superior, double-deep) and localization
     wire entering the specimen at anterior inferior aspect.  The specimen
     measures 8.0 cm SI, 6.5 cm ML, and 5.0 cm AP.  The resection margins
     are painted from superior to inferior in green, red and blue.  The
     specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral in 11 slices,
     and they are photocopied and x-rayed.  On section a firm tan well
     demarcated mass with light brown and gray gelatinous centre identified
     measuring 4.0 cm SI, 4.5 cm AP and 4.0 cm ML. It is located less than
     0.1 cm from posterior margin, 0.1 cm from anterior margin, 1.5 cm from
     superior, 2.5 cm from inferior, 0.8 cm from medial, 2.5 cm from
     lateral.  An irregular firm tan fibrotic area identified inferiorly to
     previously described mass measuring 3.0 cm SI, 3.0 cm AP, and 5.5 cm
     ML.  It is located in all slices from medial to lateral and extends up
     to the posterior margin. The tip of localization wire is located at
     the inferior part of the slices #9-10 (no mass is present and the
     tip).  Representative sections are submitted as follows:
     1-2     cross-section medial margin, slice #1
     3-5     mass and anterior margin, slices #2-4
     6     mass and superior margin, slice #4

     11     mass and anterior margin, slice #6
     12     fibrotic area and posterior margin, slice #6
     13     fibrotic area and anterior margin, slice #7
     14     mass and superior and anterior margins, slice #7
     15     mass, slice #8
     16-17     fibrotic area at the tip of localization wire, slice #8
     18-19     sections lateral to the mass, slice #9
     20-22     fibrotic area at the tip of localization wire, slice #9
     23-24     sections lateral to fibrotic area, slice #10
     25     cross-section lateral margin, slice #11
     Additional blocks submitted as follows:
     26     anterior superior margin, slice #1
     27     posterior superior margin, slice #1
     28     anterior superior margin, slice #2

CLINICAL HISTORY: Indeterminate new MRI abnormality right breast.
Probable tiny sonographic correlate at 6:30 o'clock.

REFERENCE EXAM: Comparison with previous imaging including recent
ultrasound 1/11/2008.

TECHNIQUE:

The patient has a history of Von Willebrand disease and was
administered DDAVP by the clinical referring service approximately
1 hour prior to the procedure .

Informed consent was obtained.

Initial targeted survey demonstrated the hypoechoic mass at 6
o'clock, 4 cm from the nipple, not significantly changed from
previous. This underwent subsequent core biopsy.

The right breast was cleaned and prepped in a sterile fashion. 1%
lidocaine was used as local anesthesia. Under ultrasound
guidance, the mass in the right breast was biopsied using a 14
gauge trucut needle mounted on an automated gun. Five cores were
obtained. The procedure was well tolerated and there were no
immediate complications. Specifically there was minimal bleeding
during the procedure. A clip was left at the site of biopsy.

A post-biopsy mammogram was performed which documented clip
placement in the inferior lateral right breast.

The material was sent to pathology.

Cold compression was applied to the biopsy site post-procedure and
a pressure dressing subsequently applied. The patient was given a
sheet of post biopsy instructions.

IMPRESSION:

Successful ultrasound guided core biopsy of an indeterminate right
breast mass.

Addendum report will be provided once the pathology results are
available.

Addendum # 1 by Petrina Causer on 2008-Feb-06 0920

PATHOLOGY: Negative for malignancy. Hyalinized fibrous tissue.
No evidence of atypia or malignancy.

Imaging is concordant with pathology. In order to ensure the MRI
target was biopsied, recommend repeat breast MRI to assess the
site of clip placement with respect to the target lesion, again
with the patient off hormone replacement therapy.

     INVASIVE DUCT CARCINOMA WITH FOCAL INVASIVE MICROPAPILLARY PATTERN
     
     COMMENT:
     Sections show an invasive duct carcinoma of the breast that focally
     shows an invasive micropapillary pattern.  The tumour has intermediate
     grade nuclei.  It grows in small nests without tubule formation.
     Invasive tumour necrosis is absent.  At least one focus is suspicious
     for lymphovascular invasion.  Microcalcifications are identified in
     the stroma adjacent to the invasive carcinoma.
     There is a small component of in-situ duct carcinoma; solid and
     cribriform types with intermediate nuclear grade and no comedo
     necrosis.

STEREOTACTIC GUIDED CORE BIOPSY OF LEFT BREAST

INDICATION: Cluster of calcifications in the left lower outer
breast.

COMPARISON STUDY: Mammogram June 14 2005.

FINDINGS:

Stereotactic views of the left breast demonstrated a small cluster
of calcifications in the lower outer quadrant.

After informed consent and standard prep and drape, and using 1
percent lidocaine for local anesthesia, 5 initial core biopsies
with a 14 gauge system were obtained of this lesion using an
inferior to superior approach. Initial radiograph of the
specimens failed to show calcifications.

Multiple additional core biopsies were obtained; a repeat
radiograph of the specimens demonstrated at least 2
calcifications.

There were no immediate complications.

SUMMARY:

Uneventful stereotactic guided needle core biopsies of small
cluster of calcifications in the left lower outer breast.

Pathology demonstrated fibroglandular breast tissue with focal
stromal microcalcifications. Mammographic followup with
magnification views recommended in six months' time.

     B. Left breast core biopsy:
     INVASIVE DUCT CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST
     
     Comment:
     A.  Sections show benign breast tissue as well as fat.  There is a
     cluster of atypical cells that lies detached from the surrounding
     stroma.  This fragment of tissue disappears on serial sections and
     thus its significance is unclear.  Rebiopsy of this lesion is
     suggested.
     
     B.  Sections of the breast tissue show poorly differentiated invasive
     ductal carcinoma, NOS with cancerization of lobules.  Invasive tumour
     necrosis and lymphovascular invasion are not seen.
     
     
     
     
     MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
     A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'right
     breast biopsy'. The accompanying requisition matches the container's
     label.The specimen consists of 3 cores of tan and fatty tissue, each
     with a diameter of 0.2 cm, ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 cm in length.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION
 Pre-op diagnosis: duct papilloma.
 
 SPECIMENS SUBMITTED
 Left breast needle loc lumpectomy (specimen to mammography)
 
 
 
 DIAGNOSIS
 Left breast, lumpectomy:
 LARGE BENIGN INTRADUCT PAPILLOMA SEE COMMENT
 
 COMMENT:
 Sections show a large complex intraduct papilloma. Within the
 papilloma there is florid hyperplasia, apocrine changes and areas of
 sclerosis. There is no evidence of atypia or malignancy. The lesion
 appears completely excised.
 
 
 
 
 MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
 The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
 breast lumpectomy needle localization'. The accompanying requisition
 matches the container' s label. Specimen consists of a left breast
 lumpectomy which is wire localized (x 1) and oriented with a long
 suture presumed to be lateral and a short suture presumed to be
 superior. The wire localizer is seen protruding from the anterior
 aspect. The specimen measures 2.8 cm SI by 6 cm ML by 3 cm AP. The
 resection margins are painted as follows: Green ink on the superior
 one third, blue ink on the inferior one third and red ink on the mid
 one third. The posterior resection margin is repainted with black
 dye. On serial section corresponding to the hook of the localizer
 wire is a well circumscribed mass measuring 0.3 cm in diameter. It
 has a solid white cut surface and extends to within 2 cm of the
 superior margin, 0.6 cm of the inferior margin, to within less than
 0.1 cm of the posterior margin, 1.2 cm of the anterior margin, 3.5 cm
 of the lateral margin and 2 cm of the medial margin. The tissue
 surrounding the mass is composed of dense fibrous tissue. On
 examination of the remainder of the specimen it is predominantly fatty
 with scattered glandular areas. No other masses or abnormalities are
 identified. The specimen is serially sectioned and submitted in total
 from lateral to medial in blocks one through 11, 1 is perpendicular
 sections of lateral margin, 5 and 6 demonstrates the mass, 11 is
 perpendicular sections of the medial margin.

     Core biopsy, left breast:  AT LEAST HIGH GRADE DUCT CARCINOMA IN SITU,
     PLEASE SEE COMMENT
     
     COMMENT:
     Sections examined show multiple ducts expanded by highly atypical
     malignant cells with comedo necrosis and calcification.  These are
     characteristic of high grade duct carcinoma in situ with comedo
     necrosis.  The involved ducts are surrounded by concentric fibrosis
     and dense lymphocytic infiltrate.  There is one fragment adjacent to a
     duct with carcinoma in situ.  Small clusters of single cells present
     in a dense lymphocytic infiltrate that are highly suspicious for
     invasion.  Also, small fragments of single malignant cells mixed with
     hemorrhage and necrotic fragments are present loose, however these are
     not associated with stroma to assess the presence of invasion in these
     areas.

     HER2/neu Oncoprotein Overexpression Immunohistochemistry:
     
     
     The tumor cells show strong complete membranous staining for the
     HER2/neu oncoprotein in 100% tumor cells.  This indicates that there
     is over-expression of the Her2/neu oncoprotein.  This corresponds to
     3+ positivity. Parallel positive controls were run with the test and
     were adequate.

     POSITIVE FOR HER2/NEU ONCOPROTEIN OVEREXPRESSION
     
     HER2/neu Oncoprotein Overexpression Immunohistochemistry:
     
     
     The tumor cells show strong complete membranous staining for the
     HER2/neu oncoprotein in 100% tumor cells.  This indicates that there
     is over-expression of the Her2/neu oncoprotein.  This corresponds to
     3+ positivity. Parallel positive controls were run with the test and
     were adequate.

     A: Left breast, core biopsy 8 o'clock
     B: Left breast, core biopsy 5-6 o'clock
     
     
     
     DIAGNOSIS
     A. Left breast, core biopsy 8 o'clock:
     - INVASIVE LOBULAR CARCINOMA
     
     B. Left breast, core biopsy 5-6 o'clock:
     - PROLIFERATIVE FIBROCYSTIC CHANGE WITHOUT ATYPIA
     
     Comment:
     A. Sections show low grade invasive lobular carcinoma arranged in
     single files. E-cadherin immunostaining is negative confirming the
     lobular histogenesis. There is no in situ carcinoma. There is no
     evidence of lymphovascular invasion.
     
     B. Sections show breast tissue with usual ductal hyperplasia.
     Immunohistochemical staining with CK 5/6 highlights the intraductal
     proliferation of cells supporting the diagnosis of usual ductal
     hyperplasia. There is no evidence of malignancy.

     DIAGNOSIS
     Right breast core biopsy:
     INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, NOS.
     
     COMMENT:
     A. The core biopsy shows the presence of well differentiated invasive
     ductal carcinoma NOS. Some tumour cells have a lobular pattern of
     infiltration. The tumour cells show membranous positivity for
     E-cadherin which is supportive of ductal origin. In situ ductal
     carcinoma of the solid subtype is present. The nuclear grade of the
     DCIS is 1/3. No evidence of lymphovascular invasion is noted in the
     sections examined.

 producing pleomorphic cells. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates that
 the neoplastic cells are diffusely positive for S-100 protein and ae
 focally positive for cytokeratin 5/6. The morphology and immunoprofile
 are consistent with metaplastic carcinoma with chondroid
 differentiation.

     COMMENT:
     A.  Sections of the right breast lumpectomy show the presence of
     invasive ductal carcinoma with apocrine features.  In situ ductal
     carcinoma  of the papillary  subtype showing apocrine changes is
     present.
     
     B: Sections show no residual invasive ductal carcinoma. A focus of in
     situ lobular carcinoma is present. This focus shows loss of
     e-cadherin, which is supportive of lobular origin. This focus is 1.7mm
     from the revised margin.  Focal atypical ductal hyperplasia is also
     present.

     MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
     A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'right
     breast lump sutures long patch lateral, short superior'. The
     accompanying requisition matches the container' s label.
     
     Specimen consists of an oriented right lumpectomy specimen with a long
     suture on the lateral margin and a short suture on the superior
     margin, as per the requisition.  Specimen measures 8.3-cm ML by 6.3-cm
     SI by 5.0 cm AP.  The superior one third of the surgical margin is
     painted with green dye, the middle one third with red dye and the
     inferior one third with blue dye.  For additional orientation
     purposes, black dye will be applied to the posterior surface of the
     specimen.  The specimen contains a central cyst measuring 4.4-cm ML by
     3.5-cm SI by up to 1.5-cm AP.  The cyst is closest to the anterior
     surgical margin and shows a transmural defect that measures 0.3-cm in
     diameter.  The specimen is composed of fibrofatty tissue,
     predominantly dense fibrocystic tissue surrounding the central cyst.
     The contents of the central cyst are unknown.  The cyst is partially
     lined with tan/brown papillary tissue mixed with red/brown hemorrhagic
     material.  The approximate surgical margins for this cyst are as
     follows: Lateral -- 1 .0 cm, medial -- 1.5 cm, superior -- 2 .0 cm,
     inferior -- 1 .0 cm, posterior -- 0.3-cm and anterior -- less than
     0.1-cm. representative sections are submitted as follows:
     
     1, 2     lateral margin, en face
     3     fibrocystic tissue between the lateral edge of cyst and lateral
     margin
     4, 5     lateral wall of cyst, on edge
     6     posterior surgical margin and posterior cyst wall
     7     anterior surgical margin and anterior cyst wall
     8, 9     full thickness section through cyst, including anterior and
     posterior margins
     10     superior margin
     11     inferior margin
     12     medial edge of cyst, on edge
     13, 14     medial resection margin, en face
     
     
     
     B. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'new
     medial/inferior margin'. The accompanying requisition matches the
     container' s label.
     
     Specimen consists of an irregularly shaped piece of fibrofatty tissue
     with a suture marking the new medial/inferior margin [painted with
     black dye].  The specimen measures 1.8 x 1.2 x 1 .0 cm [suture to
     opposite side].  The specimen is composed of fibrofatty tissue with
     one edge containing fat necrosis and possible cautery artifact.  The
     specimen is serially sectioned and submitted on edge in blocks 1
     through 3.

     HER2/neu Oncoprotein Overexpression Immunohistochemistry:
     
     We were asked to review our immunohistochemistry slide by Dr. C.
     Simmons.
     On review, it appears that the tumor cells show strong cytoplasmic
     staining for the HER2/neu oncoprotein thus the assessment of actual
     membranous labeling is compromised.  Therefore the tumor is equivocal
     for HER2/neu oncoprotein overexpression, corresponds to 2+ positivity.
     The case will be further studied using in situ hybridization
     technique. Parallel positive controls were run with the test and were
     adequate.

     COMMENT:
     This lumpectomy was sectioned into 9 tissue slices and submitted in
     toto in 16 blocks.  Sections show a large area of fibrosis with
     foreign body giant cell reaction measuring at least 1.5 cm in
     diameter; this is presumably the site of the previous biopsy.
     Elsewhere there is very mild non-proliferative fibrocystic disease.

     Right breast, lumpectomy:
     BENIGN BREAST TISSUE WITH FIBROSIS AND FOREIGN BODY GIANT CELL
     REACTION.  There is no evidence of atypia or malignancy.
     
     COMMENT:
     This lumpectomy was sectioned into 9 tissue slices and submitted in
     toto in 16 blocks.  Sections show a large area of fibrosis with
     foreign body giant cell reaction measuring at least 1.5 cm in
     diameter; this is presumably the site of the previous biopsy.
     Elsewhere there is very mild non-proliferative fibrocystic disease.
     There is no evidence of atypia or malignancy.

     lumpectomy show a radial scar and extensive florid usual ductal
     hyperplasia. There is a single duct with atypical ductal hyperplasia
     and occasional foci of atypical lobular hyperplasia.
     Microcalcifications are identified. There is no evidence of
     malignancy.
     Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against cytokeratin 5/6, muscle
     specific myosin and e-cadherin was used in the evaluation.

     The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     breast lump needle localization '. The accompanying requisition
     matches the container' s label.
     The specimen consists of an oriented left breast lump (long suture
     marks lateral margin , short suture superior margin, double suture
     deep margin).  The breast lump measures 3 cm M. L. by 3 cm S. I. and
     2.5 cm AP.  No skin present with the specimen.  A localizing wire is
     identified within the specimen with the tip within the superomedial
     aspect.  The specimen is serially sectioned lateral to medial and
     slices photocopied.  The lump has a diffuse firm light tan fibrotic
     appearance with few areas of adipose tissue over the posterior aspect.
     No gross tumor present.  The specimen is submitted in toto and as per
     the attached diagram as follows:
     1-2     lateral margin serially sectioned superior to inferior

     accompanying requisition matches the container' s label.
     
     The specimen consists of an oriented right breast (simple mastectomy)
     measuring 20cm ML x 20cm SI and up to 7cm AP.  The attached skin
     ellipse measures 18cm ML x 10.5cm SI.  No skin scars present.  The
     areola measures 4.5cm in diameter, the nipple measures 1cm in diameter
     and is raised 0.5cm.  A blue discoloration area identified involving
     the areola and periareolar skin measuring 6.5cm SI and 7cm ML.  The
     breast margin is painted blue.
     
     The specimen is serially sectioned and an ill-demarcated spiculated
     tumor is identified retroareolar measuring 1.3cm SI x 1.2cm AP and
     1.2cm ML.  The tumor is located 1.3cm from skin, 4cm from posterior
     margin, 9.5cm from superior margin, 5.5cm from the inferior margin,
     8cm from the medial and 10cm from the lateral margin.  The tumor is
     surrounded by firm white fibrotic tissue measuring 6cm in greatest
     dimension showing dark-blue discoloration (substance injected for
     assessment of sentinel lymph nodes).  The rest of the specimen
     consists of fibroglandular breast tissue, grossly unremarkable.  A
     hemorrhagic area is noted adjacent to tumour (site of previous
     biopsy).  The central portion of tumor is also hemorrhagic measuring
     0.5cm in greatest dimension.

 SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT
 
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION
 DCIS - microinvasion
 
 SPECIMENS SUBMITTED
 A: Sentinel node # 1, right axilla (Not blue)
 B: Sentinel node # 2, right axilla (Not blue)
 C: Right breast
 D: Inferior flap revision medial
 
 
 
 DIAGNOSIS
 A. Sentinel node #1:
 1/1 LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (0/1).
 
 B. Sentinel node #2 right axilla:
 1/1 LYMPH NODE, NEGATIVE FOR METASTATIC CARCINOMA (0/1).
 
 C. Right breast mastectomy:
 RESIDUAL IN SITU DUCTAL CARCINOMA.
 
 D. Inferior flap revision medial:
 NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.
 
 COMMENT: Sections of the sentinel lymph nodes show 2/2 lymph nodes
 are negative for metastatic carcinoma. This was confirmed using
 immunohistochemical staining with antibody to keratin.
 
 Sections of the right breast mastectomy show the presence of residual
 in situ ductal carcinoma involving 3/15 slides. The largest focus on
 one slide spans a distance of 0.7 cm. No evidence of invasion is
 present. The nests of tumor cells show positivity for myosin smooth
 muscle in myoepithelial cells, which is supportive of the absence of
 invasion. Margins: All margins are negative for in situ carcinoma.
 The closest margin is the posterior margin which is less than 1 mm
 from the DCIS. The revised inferior flap margin is negative for
 malignancy.

 MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
 A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and '1,
 sentinel node, right axilla, hot and blue'. The accompanying
 requisition matches the container' s label.
 
 The specimen consists of a tan lymph node and adipose tissue measuring
 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The lymph node is serially sectioned and
 submitted in total in 1 block for frozen section. The remaining
 fibrofatty tissue submitted in block 2.
 
 B. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and '2,
 sentinel node, right axilla, hot and blue'. The accompanying
 requisition matches the container' s label.
 
 The specimen consists of adipose and tan tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.0 x
 0.5 cm and containing a tan lymph node measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm.
 The lymph node is bisected submitted in block 1 for frozen section,
 the remaining fibrofatty tissue submitted in block 2.
 
 C. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'right
 breast sutures short -- superior, long -- lateral'. The accompanying
 requisition matches the container' s label.
 
 Specimen consists of an oriented right simple mastectomy specimen with
 a long suture on the lateral margin and a short suture on the superior
 margin, as per the requisition. The specimen measures 19.5-cm ML by
 15.0-cm SI by 3.0-cm AP. The specimen contains a horizontally
 oriented ellipse of skin that measures 11.2-cm ML by 5.9-cm SI.
 Nipple and areola are present and appear unremarkable. The skin
 contains a curvilinear well-healed scar in the upper outer quadrant
 with a length of 4.0-cm. The surgical margin on the specimen is
 painted with blue dye. The specimen is composed of fibrofatty tissue,
 predominantly adipose tissue. Located in the upper outer quadrant of
 the specimen is an area of fibrosis corresponding to a possible
 previous lumpectomy site corresponding to the superficial skin scar.
 In total the fibrosis measures 3.8-cm ML by up to 3.2-cm SI by up to
 2.0-cm AP. The approximate surgical margins to this area of fibrosis
 are as follows: Lateral -- 5 .0 cm, medial -- 6 .5 cm, superior -- 4
 .3 cm, inferior -- 4 .2 cm, anterior -- at anterior margin, posterior
 -- 0.1-cm. no mass is identified in the specimen. The specimen is
 serially sectioned and submitted to mammography for x-ray.
 Representative sections are submitted as per the accompanying diagram
 and as follows:
 
 1 lateral margin, slice 1
 2 4 metal clip, inferior of slice 6, lateral to medial
 5, 6 lateral edge, fibrosis, slice 6
 7 9 area of fibrosis, slice 7, including anterior and posterior
 margins
 10 superior margin, slice 8
 11 inferior margin, slice 8
 12, 13 fibrosis, slice 9
 14 medial edge of fibrosis, slice 10
 15 nipple and areola, slice 10
 16 medial margin, slice 14
 
 D. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and
 'inferior flap revision, medial'. The accompanying requisition matches
 the container' s label.
 
 The specimen consists of an irregularly shaped, an oriented piece of
 unremarkable fibrofatty tissue. The specimen measures 8.0 x 4.0 x 2.3
 cm. Representative cross-sections to the specimen are submitted in
 blocks 1 through 3.

     CLINICAL INFORMATION
     Highly suspicious mass left breast.  Probable ca left outer quadrant,
     calcification left inner quadrant.
     NOTE: please fax results to Dr. Curpen at ext 5266
     
     SPECIMENS SUBMITTED
     A: Left  breast biopsies - stereotactic: 14G x6
     B: Left breast biopsies - ultrasound: 14G x4 cores
     
     
     
     DIAGNOSIS
     A.  Left breast (stereotactic), core biopsy:
     IN-SITU AND INVASIVE DUCT CARCINOMA
     
     B.  Left breast (ultrasound), core biopsy:
     IN-SITU AND INVASIVE DUCT CARCINOMA
     
     COMMENT:
     The first biopsy shows predominantly in-situ carcinoma, solid and
     cribriform type with intermediate nuclear grade and comedo necrosis.
     There is a small component of invasive carcinoma, intermediate grade.
     The second biopsy shows predominantly invasive carcinoma, intermediate
     grade, with a small component of in-situ carcinoma.
     Invasive tumour necrosis and lymphovascular invasion are not seen in
     this biopsy.
     
     
     
     
     MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
     A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     breast biopsies stereotactic'. The accompanying requisition matches
     the container' s label.  The specimen consists of 5 cores of tan fatty
     tissue measuring 0.1 cm in diameter and ranging in length from 0.6-1.2
     cm.  Also separately received are 8 fragments of tan fatty tissue
     ranging in size from 0.2-0.4 cm in maximum dimension.  The specimen is
     submitted in toto in 3 blocks.
     
     B. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     breast biopsies ultrasound'. The accompanying requisition matches the
     container' s label.The specimen consists of 4 cores of tan and fatty
     tissue, each with a diameter of 0.1 cm, ranging from 0.9 to 1.4 cm in

     Comment: Representative sections of the localization lumpectomy show
     the presence of high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma of no special
     type. The tumour extends 0.6 cm (6 millimeters) superiorly, beyond the
     gross lesion, therefore it measures 2.7 cm in its largest dimension.
     Extensive lymphovascular invasion is noted in peritumoral tissue and
     away from the tumour on multiple blocks.
     Hormone receptor and Her-2/neu status will be reported in an addendum.
     The tumour characteristics are detailed in the synoptic report below:

     MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
     A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     sentinel node number 1, 787, blue'. The accompanying requisition
     matches the container' s label.  The specimen is received fresh for
     frozen section and consists of a lymph node measuring 3.5 x 1.7 x 1.0
     cm which is serially sectioned and submitted in toto in block 1-3, the
     remainder of the fibroadipose tissue is submitted in 4.
     
     B. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     axilla sentinel node number 2, 318/blue'. The accompanying requisition
     matches the container' s label.  The specimen is received fresh for
     frozen section and consists of two lymph nodes measuring 0.5 and 1.5
     cm in maximal dimension, respectively.  The smaller lymph node is
     bisected and submitted in toto in block 1 for frozen section, the
     larger lymph node is serially sectioned and submitted in toto in
     blocks 2-3 for frozen section.  The frozen section blocks are
     resubmitted as frozen section blocks 1-3, the remainder of the
     fibroadipose tissue is submitted in 4.
     
     C. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     localized lump'. The accompanying requisition matches the container' s
     label.  The specimen is received fresh for frozen section and consists
     of a lumpectomy oriented, per the requisition, long lateral, short
     superior.  The specimen measures 7.5 cm SI by 7.2 cm ML by 5.5 cm AP.
     The superior portion of the specimen is painted green, the inferior
     blue and the anterior and posterior midportion of painted red.  A
     localization wire is present with the hook in the medial specimen
     aspect.  Located within the region of the hook of the wire there is a
     firm tan poorly defined mass present measuring 2.1 cm SI by 1.7 cm ML
     by 1.5 cm AP.  Gross resection margins to this mass are anterior 0.9
     cm, posterior 1.5 cm, superior 1.2 cm, inferior 3.5 cm, medial 1.5 cm
     and lateral 4.0 cm.  No other discrete masses are identified within
     the specimen, the tissue laterally adjacent to the mass is more
     densely fibrous in nature.  Representative sections submitted as
     follows:
     1     Mass including anterior resection margin
     2     Mass including posterior resection margin
     3     Mass including superior resection margin
     4     Inferior resection margin to the mass
     5     Medial resection margin to the mass
     6     Lateral resection margin to the mass
     7-8     Additional sections of the mass
     9     Grossly unremarkable-appearing fibroadipose tissue from the
     medial inferior specimen aspect, including inferior resection
         margin
     10     Densely fibrous tissue from the lateral superior specimen
     aspect, including superior resection margin
     
     D. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     axillary contents'. The accompanying requisition matches the
     container' s label.  The specimen consists of an irregular fragment of
     fibroadipose tissue measuring 6.0 x 5.0 x 2 .0 cm, within which 10
     lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.1-3.5 cm in maximal
     dimension.  Sections submitted as follows:
     1-2     Each block containing 4 lymph nodes
     3     One lymph node
     4-5     One lymph node, serially sectioned
     
     E. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'level
     2 lymph nodes left axilla'. The accompanying requisition matches the
     container' s label.  The specimen consists of an irregular fragment of
     fibroadipose tissue measuring 4.0 x 2.0 x 1 .0 cm, within which 12
     lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.1-1.8 cm in maximal
     dimension.  Sections submitted as follows:
     1     Five lymph nodes

     MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
     A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     sentinel node number 1, 787, blue'. The accompanying requisition
     matches the container' s label.  The specimen is received fresh for
     frozen section and consists of a lymph node measuring 3.5 x 1.7 x 1.0
     cm which is serially sectioned and submitted in toto in block 1-3, the
     remainder of the fibroadipose tissue is submitted in 4.
     
     B. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     axilla sentinel node number 2, 318/blue'. The accompanying requisition
     matches the container' s label.  The specimen is received fresh for
     frozen section and consists of two lymph nodes measuring 0.5 and 1.5
     cm in maximal dimension, respectively.  The smaller lymph node is
     bisected and submitted in toto in block 1 for frozen section, the
     larger lymph node is serially sectioned and submitted in toto in
     blocks 2-3 for frozen section.  The frozen section blocks are
     resubmitted as frozen section blocks 1-3, the remainder of the
     fibroadipose tissue is submitted in 4.
     
     C. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     localized lump'. The accompanying requisition matches the container' s
     label.  The specimen is received fresh for frozen section and consists
     of a lumpectomy oriented, per the requisition, long lateral, short
     superior.  The specimen measures 7.5 cm SI by 7.2 cm ML by 5.5 cm AP.
     The superior portion of the specimen is painted green, the inferior
     blue and the anterior and posterior midportion of painted red.  A
     localization wire is present with the hook in the medial specimen
     aspect.  Located within the region of the hook of the wire there is a
     firm tan poorly defined mass present measuring 2.1 cm SI by 1.7 cm ML
     by 1.5 cm AP.  Gross resection margins to this mass are anterior 0.9
     cm, posterior 1.5 cm, superior 1.2 cm, inferior 3.5 cm, medial 1.5 cm
     and lateral 4.0 cm.  No other discrete masses are identified within
     the specimen, the tissue laterally adjacent to the mass is more
     densely fibrous in nature.  Representative sections submitted as
     follows:
     1     Mass including anterior resection margin
     2     Mass including posterior resection margin
     3     Mass including superior resection margin
     4     Inferior resection margin to the mass
     5     Medial resection margin to the mass
     6     Lateral resection margin to the mass
     7-8     Additional sections of the mass
     9     Grossly unremarkable-appearing fibroadipose tissue from the
     medial inferior specimen aspect, including inferior resection
         margin
     10     Densely fibrous tissue from the lateral superior specimen
     aspect, including superior resection margin
     
     D. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     axillary contents'. The accompanying requisition matches the
     container' s label.  The specimen consists of an irregular fragment of
     fibroadipose tissue measuring 6.0 x 5.0 x 2 .0 cm, within which 10
     lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.1-3.5 cm in maximal
     dimension.  Sections submitted as follows:
     1-2     Each block containing 4 lymph nodes
     3     One lymph node
     4-5     One lymph node, serially sectioned
     
     E. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'level
     2 lymph nodes left axilla'. The accompanying requisition matches the
     container' s label.  The specimen consists of an irregular fragment of
     fibroadipose tissue measuring 4.0 x 2.0 x 1 .0 cm, within which 12
     lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.1-1.8 cm in maximal
     dimension.  Sections submitted as follows:
     1     Five lymph nodes
     2     Four lymph nodes
     3-5     Each block containing one lymph node

     MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
     A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     sentinel node number 1, 787, blue'. The accompanying requisition
     matches the container' s label.  The specimen is received fresh for
     frozen section and consists of a lymph node measuring 3.5 x 1.7 x 1.0
     cm which is serially sectioned and submitted in toto in block 1-3, the
     remainder of the fibroadipose tissue is submitted in 4.
     
     B. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     axilla sentinel node number 2, 318/blue'. The accompanying requisition
     matches the container' s label.  The specimen is received fresh for
     frozen section and consists of two lymph nodes measuring 0.5 and 1.5
     cm in maximal dimension, respectively.  The smaller lymph node is
     bisected and submitted in toto in block 1 for frozen section, the
     larger lymph node is serially sectioned and submitted in toto in
     blocks 2-3 for frozen section.  The frozen section blocks are
     resubmitted as frozen section blocks 1-3, the remainder of the
     fibroadipose tissue is submitted in 4.
     
     C. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     localized lump'. The accompanying requisition matches the container' s
     label.  The specimen is received fresh for frozen section and consists
     of a lumpectomy oriented, per the requisition, long lateral, short
     superior.  The specimen measures 7.5 cm SI by 7.2 cm ML by 5.5 cm AP.
     The superior portion of the specimen is painted green, the inferior
     blue and the anterior and posterior midportion of painted red.  A
     localization wire is present with the hook in the medial specimen
     aspect.  Located within the region of the hook of the wire there is a
     firm tan poorly defined mass present measuring 2.1 cm SI by 1.7 cm ML
     by 1.5 cm AP.  Gross resection margins to this mass are anterior 0.9
     cm, posterior 1.5 cm, superior 1.2 cm, inferior 3.5 cm, medial 1.5 cm
     and lateral 4.0 cm.  No other discrete masses are identified within
     the specimen, the tissue laterally adjacent to the mass is more
     densely fibrous in nature.  Representative sections submitted as
     follows:
     1     Mass including anterior resection margin
     2     Mass including posterior resection margin
     3     Mass including superior resection margin
     4     Inferior resection margin to the mass
     5     Medial resection margin to the mass
     6     Lateral resection margin to the mass
     7-8     Additional sections of the mass
     9     Grossly unremarkable-appearing fibroadipose tissue from the
     medial inferior specimen aspect, including inferior resection
         margin
     10     Densely fibrous tissue from the lateral superior specimen
     aspect, including superior resection margin
     
     D. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
     axillary contents'. The accompanying requisition matches the
     container' s label.  The specimen consists of an irregular fragment of
     fibroadipose tissue measuring 6.0 x 5.0 x 2 .0 cm, within which 10
     lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.1-3.5 cm in maximal
     dimension.  Sections submitted as follows:
     1-2     Each block containing 4 lymph nodes
     3     One lymph node
     4-5     One lymph node, serially sectioned
     
     E. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'level
     2 lymph nodes left axilla'. The accompanying requisition matches the
     container' s label.  The specimen consists of an irregular fragment of
     fibroadipose tissue measuring 4.0 x 2.0 x 1 .0 cm, within which 12
     lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.1-1.8 cm in maximal
     dimension.  Sections submitted as follows:

 MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
 A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
 breast'. The accompanying requisition matches the container's label.
 The specimen consists of a simple mastectomy oriented, per the
 requisition, suture axillary tail. The specimen measures 22.0 cm SI
 by 24.0 cm ML by 6.3 cm AP. The resection margin is painted with blue
 dye. Skin is present measuring 8.0 cm SI by 18.0 cm ML. Nipple and
 areola appear grossly unremarkable. Two scars are present the first
 is oblique present within the upper outer quadrant measuring 5.0 cm in
 length. The second scar is irregular in shape and located superior
 to the oblique scar and present within the upper outer quadrant at the
 12:30 position measuring 1.5 cm SI by 1.8 cm ML. Deep to both scars
 there is a previous surgical site present straddling the upper and
 lower outer quadrants and measuring 7.0 cm SI by 7.0 cm ML by 4.2 cm

 MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
 A. The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'left
 breast'. The accompanying requisition matches the container's label.
 The specimen consists of a simple mastectomy oriented, per the
 requisition, suture axillary tail. The specimen measures 22.0 cm SI
 by 24.0 cm ML by 6.3 cm AP. The resection margin is painted with blue
 dye. Skin is present measuring 8.0 cm SI by 18.0 cm ML. Nipple and
 areola appear grossly unremarkable. Two scars are present the first
 is oblique present within the upper outer quadrant measuring 5.0 cm in
 length. The second scar is irregular in shape and located superior
 to the oblique scar and present within the upper outer quadrant at the
 12:30 position measuring 1.5 cm SI by 1.8 cm ML. Deep to both scars
 there is a previous surgical site present straddling the upper and
 lower outer quadrants and measuring 7.0 cm SI by 7.0 cm ML by 4.2 cm
 AP (present within slices 2-5). Gross resection margins to this area
 are anterior tethering the skin, posterior tethering, superior 1.0 cm
 (superoanterior located at 1.5 cm superior to the superior skin
 margin, inferior 3.0 cm, medial 7.5 cm and lateral 4.0 cm. Upon
 palpating this scarred region it has a firm nodular quality. Located
 within the lower outer quadrant there is a second poorly defined firm
 area of nodularity 1.0 cm medial and 1.5 cm inferior to the surgical
 site and covering a region measuring 1.5 cm SI by 1.5 cm ML by 1.5 cm
 AP (slices 6-7). Gross resection margins to this area are anterior
 2.0 cm, posterior 2.7 cm, superior 11.5 cm, inferior 1.8 cm, medial
 4.0 cm and lateral 10.5 cm. Also present within the lower outer
 quadrant inferiorly adjacent to the scarred region there is a brown
 well defined nodule close to the lateral edge of the surgical site
 (slice 3) measuring 0.7 cm SI by 0.5 cm ML by 0.5 cm AP. Gross
 resection margins to this nodule are anterior 3.8 cm, posterior 1.0
 cm, superior 12.5 cm, inferior 8.8 cm, medial 4.0 cm and lateral 14.0

     A.  The core biopsy shows the presence of moderately differentiated
     invasive ductal carcinoma NOS.  Foci of in situ ductal carcinoma of
     the solid subtype are present.  The nuclear grade of in situ ductal
     carcinoma is 1-2/3.  The invasive and in situ ductal carcinoma show
     membranous positivity for E-cadherin which is supportive of ductal
     origin.  Foci suspicious for lymphovascular invasion are present.
     
     B.  The core biopsy shows the presence of moderately differentiated
     invasive ductal carcinoma NOS.  In situ ductal carcinoma of the solid
     subtype is present.  The nuclear grade of in situ ductal carcinoma is
     1-2/3.
     
     C.  The core biopsy shows the presence of proliferative fibrocystic
     changes.  Focal usual ductal hyperplasia is present.  These foci show
     positivity for CK5/6 which is supportive of benign ductal
     proliferation.  Focal columnar cell changes are also present.

     DIAGNOSIS
     Left breast core biopsy:
     AT LEAST ATYPICAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA.
     
     COMMENT:  The core biopsy shows the presence of one duct with a
     cribriform morphology. The features in this duct are those of low
     grade in situ ductal carcinoma, cribriform type.  Adjacent ducts show
     focal atypical ductal hyperplasia. Since only one duct shows features
     of low grade in situ ductal carcinoma, the diagnosis is consistent
     with atypical ductal hyperplasia. Dystrophic calcification is noted
     within the breast ducts.

     SPECIMENS SUBMITTED
     Right breast biopsy
     
     
     
     DIAGNOSIS
     Right breast, core biopsy:
     -          AT LEAST ATYPICAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA (PLEASE SEE COMMENT)
     
     Comment: Specimen shows mainly benign breast fibroadipose tissue with
     dilated breast duct (ductectasia). A small focus of atypical ductal
     proliferation, suspicious for ductal carcinoma in situ, measuring 1.5
     mm was identified. The focus is quantitatively short of diagnosis of
     DCIS. Excision of the breast lesion is recommended.
     
     
     
     
     MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
     The specimen container is labeled with the patient name and 'right
     breast MR VAB'. The accompanying requisition matches the container's
     label.
     The specimen consists of approximately 3 cc's of soft tan and fatty
     tissue pieces which are submitted in toto in 3 blocks

HISTORY: Left mammographic and sonographic mass and
calcifications, outside FNA positive but core biopsy negative for
malignancy. Right sonographic mass.

Films were compared with previous outside imaging.

FINDINGS:

MAMMOGRAM/MAGNIFICATION VIEWS:

The breast tissue is dense.

There is an obscured mass in the left lower outer anterior breast
with overlying calcifications; the calcifications that directly
overlie the mass are fine and irregular. Some additional
calcifications extend roughly 4 cm posterior and 5 cm superior to
the mass are punctate and loosely scattered, with a benign
appearance.

There are right central calcifications; magnification views show
these to be in a loose cluster with some punctate calcifications
and many of the calcifications showing layering on the straight
lateral view, with a benign appearance

There is no architectural distortion.

ULTRASOUND:

Targeted right breast ultrasound to the upper outer quadrant shows
shadowing tissue and scattered cysts. In the 11 o'clock position
5 cm from the nipple there is a vague avascular hypoechoic lesion
measuring 1.2 x 0.5 x 1.0 cm. This corresponds to the lesion
imaged on the outside ultrasound. The appearance today is more in
keeping with a fat lobule rather than a solid mass like a
fibroadenoma.

Left axillary ultrasound shows a couple of lymph nodes with
slightly prominent cortex, marker measures 1.1 x 0.6 x 2.3 cm,
with the cortex measuring 0.4 cm. The fatty hilum is preserved.

Whole left breast ultrasound shows shadowing tissue and scattered
cysts. In the 5 o'clock position 2 cm from the nipple,
corresponding to the mammographic mass and calcifications, there
is an avascular hypoechoic irregular mass with posterior shadowing
measuring 1.9 x 1.1 x 1.9 cm. There are prominent arteries on
either side of the mass.

BIOPSY:

Informed consent. Sterile technique and ultrasound guidance used.
The skin/subcutaneous tissues over the axillary lymph node and
breast mass were infiltrated with 5 cc of 2% lidocaine. An 18G
needle was inserted into the axillary lymph node cortex and
aspiration was performed. Sample sent in a container to cytology.
No immediate complications. A skin nick was made over the breast
mass. A 14G core biopsy needle was used to obtain 4 samples
however the samples were small and fragmented, thus a 16G core
biopsy needle was used to obtain 5 samples. Samples sent in
container to pathology. No immediate complications.
IMPRESSION:

1. Right and left mammographic calcifications are likely benign,
recommend 6 month follow up magnification views.

2. Right sonographic mass is likely benign, recommend 6 month
targeted ultrasound.

3. Left mammographic and sonographic mass and overlying
calcifications are suspicious - core biopsy was performed and an
addendum will be dictated when pathology results are available.

4. Left axillary lymph node is indeterminate - fine needle
aspiration was performed and an addendum will be dictated when
cytology results are available.

5. Dense breasts. Due to the suspicious mass, recommend breast
MRI. Please submit a requisition for this.

Addendum # 1 by Carrie Betel on 2009-Oct-14 0937

ADDENDUM:

Cytology of the axillary lymph node is benign. This is concordant
with imaging. Recommend 6 month ultrasound follow up.

Pathology shows ALH/LCIS. Please refer to the full pathology
report. This could be concordant with imaging however surgical
excision is recommended to exclude underlying invasive malignancy.

Note that breast MRI has been performed, please refer to that
report for MRI findings and recommendations.

Also note that bilateral magnification views and right targeted
ultrasound in 6 months are also recommended.

     Left breast core biopsy:
     ATYPICAL DUCTAL HYPERPLASIA (see comment).
     
     COMMENT:  The core biopsy shows the presence of one duct showing
     atypical epithelial proliferation and extensive calcification.  The
     duct shows loss of CK5/6 which is supportive of atypical epithelial
     proliferation.  A portion of an adjacent duct also shows loss of
     CK5/6.  The overall features are consistent with the diagnosis of at
     least atypical ductal hyperplasia.

     specified.  The tumour shows some tubule formation.  Nuclear grade is
     low to intermediate.  Invasive tumour necrosis is absent and
     lymphovascular invasion are not seen in the sections examined.
     Calcifications are seen associated with both the tumour as well as
     benign breast tissue.  There is a very small amount of in-situ tumour,
     solid type, with low nuclear grade and no comedo necrosis.
